HILLHOUSE 

The grandest street in America
is paved with brick-and-bone. 

Each day, four thousand kids run across
the street to speak new histories.

Two churches watch each other and no one
climbs the belfrey, that part is only a dream.

Biology must have taught us somewhere
which joints were meant to suture and
which ones were meant to continue the
dissolution of all granite all sons downhill.

Right by the corner, the birth of an amendmentâ€“
and in the underside, an inhabitant buries

the inheritance. Imagine the smell of bark,
pourover, drying leaves, and sinew-strapped

anxieties. When you walk from end-to-start
(either way) the leaves do not hum but

stand ancient. The wildgrass grows but only 
for seven days. And evening ascends 

and the foothill quiets, and our heels
come pinpricked with the grove.

And all our citizens (if you can be one)
climb ditches and run experiments and slip
on concrete with no one to watch. Letting 
the beartrap lose and all his marching

acquiesce. So tomorrow, again, when all
this comes and we are past mercy (this

one is an anecdote) the kid war stops at 
ancient intersection to strife his feet 

on holy ground.
