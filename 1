BEFORE, WE PRAY UNTIL SUNDOWN

Fourteen years after the fact
we tried to puncture our bodies too.

I lifted your palm on Easter, for some
the same before May. There I sat you down
and the Father told you about our owned
salvation. Later a street preacher took
your foot and  backtowel and gave you
proof of the beginning. No one could
interfere with you and the Word. 

In pithy I recited the coronation again:
over two-thousand years after the fact
we have yet to bury his death itself. 

When I swallow, you swallow 
too, and my mouth becomes cavernous or 
crossing––like the way he lept. 

You have a hole in your hair. I strain
poultice. I praise you. I fashion your cuts
and strip sampaguita. The angels watch
without consequence. (And watch man fall
into his own suffering.)

And sixteen hours after the fact 
your eyes are shot with fervor. When 
I am young I am told I must fear to be
saved.

When pressed against the nave a womb
must condense like gravestone: like cradle,
like the weight of his mother, like him, his
own.
