BEFORE, WE PRAY UNTIL SUNDOWN

Fourteen years after the fact
we tried to puncture our bodies too.

I lifted your palm on Easter, or maybe
it was before May. There I sat you down
and the Father told you about our own
salvation. Later a street preacher took
your feet and backtowel and taught you
the proof of the beginning. No one could
interfere with you and the Word. 

In pithy I recited the coronation again:
over two-thousand years after the fact
we have yet to bury the way he died. My 
sorrow is beginning to come for no one 
but myself. When I swallow, you swallow 
too, and my mouth becomes cavernous or 
crossing––like the way he lept. 

You have a hole in your hair, I strain
poultice––I praise you. I fashion your cuts
and strip sampaguitas. The angels watch
without consequence again.

And sixteen hours after the fact 
your eyes are shot with fervor and piety
and pulse of sin unowned. 

When pressed against the nave a womb
must condense like gravestone: like cradle,
like the weight of his mother, like him, his
own.
