WHEN IT BECOMES THE BETTER OPTION

I was there in the lungs of the world
stricken, rebuilding the walls I could
and it was there we downed. Tell them
some elegy where I die with my ankles
bound cleanly-sung over Jerusalem. Let
them know I cradled hell too, in its last
moments. However fetal and buzzing 
and stenched of death and rocking at 
the merciless voice of the world you don't
let men pry at your black busted toenails
or open the hotel room door. No one 
is supposed to mourn when the body excavates
itself or is hunted by the last one possible.
