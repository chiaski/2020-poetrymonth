Constantine,
I dream of you a conquerer.
Blessed three-thirds down and two blocks
more. You smell of Guadalupe and skid knees.
The king in these parts is much beloved
but by the martyrs. The next generation
grows up to kiss him by the neck, by 
the rugged battlescar and its warwater song.
In the quarry, before the feast, 
he took count of us in silence then left
us to die. He rapt the good to the holy
placeâ€“not upwards but beyond Constantine.
I dug grave and pricked an infant clean
to save my spot and tongue. The king, again,
saved me: saved seven-hundred more, decried
the lifeless body pored for him and wept.
