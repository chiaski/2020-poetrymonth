BLOOD-LETTING
We used to dream of wings. 
    In it, I would rest on buoys
    atop the Celebes Sea imagining
    what it must feel to swallow: 
    there is the rain and there
    is the monsoon. This weather
    is fit for passing. My sister,
    squinting at the seafoam shines
    like the froth of bodies left in 
    shallow creeks. Another time
    an incontinent man leaps–the wingspan
    of god himself–to bruise and 
    birth an infestation of the next
    commune. When a young boy begs for
    retreat they direct him to save 
    the last twenty who had jumped. He 
    carried himself the methane carcass
    and bore the twenty-seven holes. When
    I dream, I dream of you, bliss, Eve,
    the grounding of a plane and last 
    breaths before unconsciousnness. Other
    times it's the body in the creek in 
    front of the shack in Manila (the street
    is lined with garbage bags and creaking
    silver) and underground a boy retires 
    before his Father. Backs breaking, rested
    on the bedrock where a lone bird sings 
    as it picks at the webbings of their 
    little brother's feet.
