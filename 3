BLOOD-LETTING
We used to dream of wings. 
    In it, I would rest on buoys
    atop the Celebes Sea imagining
    what it must feel to swallow: 
    there is the rain and there
    is the monsoon. This weather
    is fit for passing. My sister,
    squinting at the seafoam shines
    like the froth of bodies left in 
    shallow creeks. Another time
    an incontinent man leaps–the wingspan
    of god himself–to bruise and 
    birth an infestation of the next
    commune. When a young boy begs for
    retreat they direct him to save 
    the last twenty who had jumped. He 
    carried himself the methane carcass
    sentenced for incision.


When I went to the west I let the birdsong
feast on all these letters.
