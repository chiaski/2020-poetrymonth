(some poem about my homesickness)

When all I can write about is a god
that I have already abandoned I cannot stop
turning back. I see skylines faintly. I leave
boxcutters on the floor. Outside, on Church Street,
a floret fell from my pocket. When I weep
I taste candlewax and incense. This poem
could have been born in a valley. "So tender
this is," I think quietly, when I exchange antiseptic
with my parents and do not see them for two years.
It is inaudable almost when a stranger catches
my footfall in these new histories. When I walk into
markets and smell plastic before soy. Careful,
almost, there was a slip of tongue and a dream of
missing home: last night my head was on my sister's
lap in the mausoleum again. Last night Manila was 
spread on the mattress. That was the archipelago.
"How resilient!" My counselor says.
